	        <summary>The Ryan Giggs story goes on - and on and on - and still his powers show no sign of waning. No longer the daring, dashing left-winger who tormented full-backs but a calming influence and one of the sharpest passers around.</summary>
	        <description>
	            Although his legs may have lost the explosive acceleration, his brain remains ahead of his younger rivals and his ability to produce telling crosses and assists has never been better. In summary, the Welshman is a phenomenon and a footballer to be treasured and talked about in revered tones long after he eventually decides to hang up his boots.

Bryan Robson feels that may not be until he has slipped into his 40s. A man who was not named PFA Players' Player until 2009 remains a key part of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad. An ally to the boss and an indvidual who commands total respect in the dressing room.

The most decorated player in the British game, the potential that earned him two PFA Young Player of the Year awards earlier in his career has long since been realised. Ryan is United's record appearance-maker; he surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton's 758 on the night he helped the Reds secure a third European Cup triumph - his second - in Moscow on 21 May 2008.</description>

	        <summary>David De Gea is a product of Atletico Madrid’s academy. Tall, athletic and confident with the ball, he progressed quickly through the youth ranks and spent his first professional season, 2008/09, with the club’s reserves. A first-team debut arrived early in the following term via a substitute appearance against FC Porto in the UEFA Champions League on 30 September 2009 - and thereafter he never looked back.</summary>
	        <description>
	            De Gea capped his maiden campaign in Atletico Madrid's first team by playing a major role in winning the UEFA Europa League - the club's first major European trophy in almost 50 years. 

His already burgeoning reputation was further enhanced during his second full season in La Liga and rumours of United's interest, which had first surfaced in January 2010, were more widely circulated when the Reds' then goalkeeping coach Eric Steele was seen scouting the youngster.

By the end of the 2010/11 season, David was widely touted by several media outlets as the primary choice to replace the retiring Edwin van der Sar at Old Trafford, although talks were put on hold whilst he helped Spain win UEFA’s Under-21 European Championship in Denmark. The transfer was completed after the tournament, on 29</description>

	        <summary>Combining attacking ambition with defensive strength, Rafael da Silva is perhaps  the personification of the modern full-back.</summary>
	        <description>
	        The Brazilian starlet is already a full international, having excelled at United since making his first team debut during a 1-1 draw with Newcastle in August 2008 - a surprise outing that was prompted by an inspired display in Barry Fry's testimonial earlier in the month.

Incredibly, what made Rafa's bow even more impressive was the fact he hadn't played competitively in over a year while the Reds applied for international clearance on his (and twin brother

Fabio) transfer from Fluminense.

With surpreme confidence and ambition, he made several noteworthy appearances thoughout the 2008/09 campaign, scoring his first goal at Arsenal in November before staking a claim for the full-time right-back berth ahead of Messrs Neville and Brown.

As a result, Sir Alex Ferguson soon offered a two-year contract extension and a nomination for the PFA Young Player of the Year award was soon won, as well as a place on the bench for the UEFA Champions League final defeat to Barcelona.

	        <summary>Patrice Evra has been incredibly consistent since arriving at Old Trafford in 2006, dominating the left-back position while regularly wearing the captain's armband in the absence of Nemanja Vidic. </summary>
	        <description>
	            The Frenchman's passionate persona has also made him a cult hero on the terraces and few will have felt more pride when the Reds reclaimed the Barclays Premier League at a canter in 2012/13 following the drama and heartbreak of the previous season.

United beat Liverpool, Arsenal and Inter Milan to Evra's signature in January 2006 when Sir Alex

Ferguson splashed the cash to shore up his defence, also bringing in the talismanic Vidic just a few days later.

Although only 24 at the time, Patrice had already been capped five times for France and was club captain at Monaco, where his reputation as an intelligent, attack-minded full-back had already been established.

In fact, he was a big success at the club, having won the 2003 French League Cup before reaching the 2004 UEFA Champions League final under manager Didier Deschamps, who was admittedly a big influence: "He transmitted to me the bug of winning at any price."</description>
