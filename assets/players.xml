	        <summary>The Ryan Giggs story goes on - and on and on - and still his powers show no sign of waning. No longer the daring, dashing left-winger who tormented full-backs but a calming influence and one of the sharpest passers around.</summary>
	        <description>
	            Although his legs may have lost the explosive acceleration, his brain remains ahead of his younger rivals and his ability to produce telling crosses and assists has never been better. In summary, the Welshman is a phenomenon and a footballer to be treasured and talked about in revered tones long after he eventually decides to hang up his boots.

Bryan Robson feels that may not be until he has slipped into his 40s. A man who was not named PFA Players' Player until 2009 remains a key part of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad. An ally to the boss and an indvidual who commands total respect in the dressing room.

The most decorated player in the British game, the potential that earned him two PFA Young Player of the Year awards earlier in his career has long since been realised. Ryan is United's record appearance-maker; he surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton's 758 on the night he helped the Reds secure a third European Cup triumph - his second - in Moscow on 21 May 2008.</description>
